# ZeroKB - The no framework CSS framework
    
ZeroKB is the CSS framework you want when you don't want a CSS 
framework. The advent of CSS frameworks such as Bootstrap have been
a great boon for design-starved startups, but these frameworks often
have some  unfortunate side-effects:

* Webpages and apps are often bloated with framework CSS, often 90% of which isn't even used by the page design.
* Websites built with these frameworks often all look the same, it's fairly easy to spot a bootstrap startup.
* Developers don't learn anything about CSS, and when something goes wrong they lack the skills to fix the problems themselves.

ZeroKB is an attempt to replace large CSS frameworks with a simple
set of guidelines that will:

* Allow you to design pages the way you want.
* Work across all modern browsers.
* Supports LESS, SASS and any future CSS pre-compilers.
* Make you a more rounded developer.
